[**Everything**](https://www.voidtools.com/) is a free Windows search engine. Type the partial file or folder name into the search edit, and the results will appear instantly. The utility has a clean and simple user interface, uses very little system resources. 'Everything' even allows to search for file's content, though it will be slow because contents is not indexed. In some cases [advanced searching](https://www.voidtools.com/faq/#searching) can be applied as well.
