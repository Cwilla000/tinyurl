# Intro

Welcome to **`Tiny tools`**, a collection of fast, minimalist, single-purpose apps and tools which are designed to be lightweight, simple but still incredibly useful to solve everyday problems and tasks.

An app will likely be listed here if it's:
- native, fast and lightweight
- single purpose
- open source
- live (actively maintained)
- used (or would be used) by myself

Please use sidebar for site navigation. In case of problems, suggestions or questions please [open an issue](https://github.com/chilikasha/tinytools/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/chilikasha/tinytools/discussions).
