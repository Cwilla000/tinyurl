# Intro

Welcome to Tiny tools, a collection of apps and tools designed to be super simple but still incredibly useful. An app will likely be listed here if it's:

- native, fast and lightweight
- single purpose
- open source
- live (actively maintained)
- used (or would be used) by myself

Hope you'll find something new and useful for yourself.
