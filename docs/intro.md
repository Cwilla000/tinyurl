Welcome to **Tiny tools**, a collection of apps and tools designed to be super simple but still incredibly useful.  An app will likely be listed here if it's:
- native, fast and lightweight
- single purpose
- beautiful
- open source
- live (actively maintained)
- used (or would be used) by myself

If you have a suggestion of an app that can be included in the list, then please submit it [here](https://airtable.com/shr5X8eog0uy8Ab1K).  
For any questions or just to say "Hi!" please ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tinytools_club).

Hope you'll find something new and useful for yourself.
