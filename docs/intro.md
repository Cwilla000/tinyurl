# Intro

Welcome to `Tiny tools`, a collection of apps and tools designed to be super simple but still incredibly useful. An app will likely be listed here if it's:

- native, fast and lightweight
- single purpose
- open source
- live (actively maintained)
- used (or would be used) by myself

Please use sidebar for site navigation. In case of problems, suggestions or questions please [open an issue](https://github.com/akapitoha/tinytools/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/akapitoha/tinytools/discussions).

Hope you'll find something new and useful.
