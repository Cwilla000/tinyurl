[**Espanso**](https://espanso.org/) is a cross-platform open source text expander. It detects when you type a specific keyword and replaces it with something else. Thus you can avoid typing the same text or prepare commonly used code snippets. There's also a hub of [packages](https://hub.espanso.org/) to expand the possibilities. For someone, Espanso may seem not very user-friendly in installation and setting up, but it's still a great tiny tool that does its job.
