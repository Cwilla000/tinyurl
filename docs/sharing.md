## Snapdrop
[**Snapdrop**](https://snapdrop.net/) is a free, open source, browser based AirDrop alternative. This handy app lets you share text and files between devices on the same network. Talking about [privacy](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/blob/master/docs/faq.md#what-about-privacy-will-files-be-saved-on-third-party-servers) none of your files are ever sent to any server, files are sent only between peers.

?> You can also try [sharedrop.io](https://www.sharedrop.io/) as an alternative.

## Wormhole
[**Wormhole**](https://wormhole.app/) is a simple and safe way to send files and folders. All your shared data is end-to-end encrypted and is automatically expired after 24 hours. Upload size is limited to 10GB.
