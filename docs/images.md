## [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php)
An open source free tool for creating, editing, composing or converting digital images of different formats. It's cross-platform and has lots of features and capabilities. Personally needed to quickly combine several screenshots and did it with just one command:

```bash
brew install imagemagick
convert +append 1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg best.jpg
```

## [qView](https://interversehq.com/qview/)
Image viewer designed with minimalism and usability in mind. No cluttered interface, just your image and a titlebar. A nice piece of cross-platform, free and open source software.
