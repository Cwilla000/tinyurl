## ImageMagick
An open source [free tool](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php) for creating, editing, composing or converting digital images of different formats. It's cross-platform and has lots of features and capabilities. Personally needed to quickly combine several screenshots and did it with just one command:

```bash
brew install imagemagick
convert +append 1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg best.jpg
```

## qView
[**qView**](https://interversehq.com/qview/) is an image viewer designed with minimalism and usability in mind. No cluttered interface, just your image and a titlebar. A nice piece of cross-platform, free and open-source software.
