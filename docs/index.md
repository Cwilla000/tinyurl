# Welcome to <span style={{"color": "rgb(53, 120, 229)"}}>Tiny&nbsp;tools</span>.

A collection of fast, minimalist, single-purpose apps and tools which are designed to be lightweight, simple but still incredibly useful to solve everyday problems and tasks. An app will likely be listed here if it's:
- native, fast and lightweight
- single-purpose
- open source
- live (actively maintained)
- used (or would be used) by myself

Please use sidebar for site navigation. In case of problems, suggestions or questions you can contact me via <a href="mailto:tinytools@sent.com">email</a>.
