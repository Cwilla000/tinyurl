# Welcome to Tiny tools

A collection of fast, minimalist, single-purpose apps and tools which are designed to be lightweight, simple but still incredibly useful to solve everyday problems and tasks. An app will likely be listed here if it's:
- native, fast and lightweight
- single-purpose
- open source
- live (actively maintained)
- used (or would be used) by myself
