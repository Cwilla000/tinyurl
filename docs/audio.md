## Micdrop
[**Mic Drop**](https://getmicdrop.com) does one thing: mutes your mic in any app with a global keyboard shortcut or a menu bar control. That's it. For a free but less simple solution please refer to [this](https://medium.com/macoclock/how-in-the-bleep-do-i-mute-my-mic-anywhere-on-macos-d2fa1185b13) article.

## Recordia
[**Recordia**](https://sindresorhus.com/recordia) lets you record audio directly from the menu bar or with a global keyboard shortcut. This can be useful for recording voice memos, song ideas, meetings, lectures, interviews, phone calls, voice-overs, and more. Records duration is not limited and audio can be compressed or lossless.

?> Other options: macOS [voice memos](https://support.apple.com/guide/voice-memos/record-vmaa4b813415/mac) or [Piezo](https://rogueamoeba.com/piezo/) app.
