## [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
A lightweight free tool that can capture an area of your desktop and save to a `.GIF` file. What is great about this app is that you can move the screen capture frame while recording and also make a pause any time and then resume. You can also record mouse button presses and adjust maximum recording frame rate. LICEcap has a tiny installation file size of less than 1MB and works on Windows and macOS.
