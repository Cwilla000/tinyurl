[**Snapdrop**](https://snapdrop.net/) is a free, open source, browser based AirDrop alternative. This handy app lets you share text and files between devices on the same network. Talking about [privacy](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/blob/master/docs/faq.md#what-about-privacy-will-files-be-saved-on-third-party-servers) none of your files are ever sent to any server, files are sent only between peers.
