Lately I've been thinking a lot about making my own app, a free or paid one it doesn't matter, but my own. Ideally something useful, at least for myself...
<!--truncate-->
But there are several problems:
- I'm not a developer
- I don't have any **idea**

First one may seem not a big problem for me. Yes, I don't code, but I learn fast, and have a will.
Second one is more serious for me. I broke my brains to come up with at least something, a tiny project, anything. But no. That's why the Internet now has [tinytools.club](http://tinytools.club/).

Eventually there are several reasons why this site exists:
1. I like trying new apps. Constantly. I can switch between todo apps every month and move all my todos back and forth.
2. I like small, fast and minimal apps and I admire people who make them.
3. This site is an attempt to make at least something by myself.
4. Other people can learn about wonderful but lesser known apps.
5. While curating this collection I hope to find an idea for my own app.

That's it. Oh, and just some facts about the site itself:
- Domain was bought on Namecheap.
- First version was made with [nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra), but later I moved to [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) because it's more customizable.
- The site is deployed and hosted with [vercel](https://vercel.com/). And that was rather easy to do.
